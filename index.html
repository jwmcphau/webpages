	<p>My name is William McPhaul. I am a first year student. My intended major is chemical engineering because I want to work as an engineer in the pharmacuetical industry.</p>
	<br />
	<p>Over the summer I worked in Morehead City, NC. I was a waiter at a seafood restaurant on the water. I hated my job.</p>
